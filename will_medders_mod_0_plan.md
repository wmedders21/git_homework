### *A gameplan for success*

1. Code every day

```
abc = "A.B.C. Always be coding!"
qn = "Quit now"

puts "Do you want keep your skills sharp? Y/N"

answer = gets.chomp

if answer == "y" || answer == "Y"
    puts abc
else
    puts qn
end
```
2. Maintain Calendar as a living document

  * Update changes as they occur
  * Allow more than sufficient time for challenging tasks
  * Use the Trello board to stay organized
  * Build in time for self-care


3. Ask the **right** questions

  * Google first and try to troubleshoot in an educated way (checking lesson notes)
  * Ask for help after being stuck 20-30 minutes
  * Include the specific issue, attempted solutions, screenshots, and code when reaching out.


4. Take care of my health `puts "fitter happier more productive"`
   * Take Pom breaks when necessary
   * Wear my fancy blue filter glasses
   * Drink water
   * Go outside and run around
